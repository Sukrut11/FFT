# 🎵 FFT Audio Filtering in Python

This project demonstrates how to **generate**, **analyze**, and **filter** audio signals using the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** in Python.  
You’ll learn how to create synthetic sine waves, mix noise, perform frequency-domain filtering, and reconstruct the cleaned signal.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Generate synthetic sine waves at custom frequencies  
- Combine multiple tones and add noise  
- Visualize signals in both time and frequency domains  
- Use **FFT** and **Inverse FFT (IFFT)** for signal analysis and filtering  
- Save and play `.wav` audio files  
- Demonstrate simple noise removal in the frequency domain

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed and the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib librosa ipython
